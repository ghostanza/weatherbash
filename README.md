# weatherbash

This script connects to the Weather Underground API to bring weather forecasts to your command line.

## Basic Usage
* The script has a default `loc` variable, this will be used by default.
* The default display from calling `./weather` displays your location, a brief message about the weather, the temperature, and the "feels like" temperature
